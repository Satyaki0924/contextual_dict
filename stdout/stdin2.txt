bat
['Noun']
Bat-and-ball games (or safe haven games to avoid confusion with club games such as golf and hockey) are field games played by two opposing teams.[1] The teams alternate between "batting" roles, sometimes called "in at bat" and "out in the field", or simply in and out. Only the batting team may score, but they have equal chances in both roles. The game is counted rather than timed.
